            fresh graduates</p>
        <p class="text-1" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">The IT industry has witnessed rapid growth in
            recent years, with new technologies constantly
            emerging and revolutionising various sectors. As a result, the demand for skilled IT
            professionals has skyrocketed. Unfortunately, this growth presents challenges for fresh
            graduates looking to enter the IT job market. These challenges include fierce competition, lack
            of practical experience, and the ever-present skill gap. Therefore, it becomes crucial to bridge
            the gap between fresh graduates and IT jobs to ensure their success in this dynamic industry.</p>
